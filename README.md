Simple NTP clock using ESP32 for GRA &amp; AFCH Nixie Arduino HAT NCS314-6 v3.4

Wanted a simple application to use an ESP32 UNO style board on an GRA and AFCH Nixie clock Arduino hat (NCS314-6 v3.4) available on ebay and NTP discipline itâ€¦

eBay listing said clock had a DS3231SN RTC but mine came with a RV3028

additionally said LEDs were PWM controlled but clock came with addressable LEDs

so obviously YMMV on hardware

Libraries required:
